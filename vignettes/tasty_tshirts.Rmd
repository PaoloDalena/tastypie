The `tasty t-shirts` are available in black, blue and gray.
Some people with no taste might say that they are simply a plain T-shirt with the `tastypie` logo, but the real experts know that this is the latest fashion trend and would do anything to get one.

To get a fantastic `tasty t-shirt` **for free**, just follow these steps:

  + [send me an e-mail](https://paolodalena.netlify.app/#contact) saying you are interested in the shirt;
  + send me a picture of you wearing a basic t-shirt of any kind;
  + I'll upload on [tastypie_rpkg](https://www.instagram.com/tastypie_rpkg/) the photo with the logo photoshopped on your t-shirt;
  + when it reaches 50 likes, send me your address and I'll send to you the shirt for free (you only have to pay the shipping costs).
