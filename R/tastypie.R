#' You only need to type
#' \href{https://www.google.com/search?q=why+pie+charts+are+bad}{why pie charts are bad}
#' on Google to find thousands of articles full of (*valid*) reasons why other types of charts
#' should be preferred over this one.\cr
#' Therefore, because of the little use due to the reasons already mentioned,
#' making pie charts (and related) in R is not straightforward, so other functions are needed
#' to simplify things.\cr
#' In this R package there are useful functions to make *tasty* pie charts immediately
#' by exploiting the many cool templates provided.\cr\cr
