# tastypie 0.0.3

* Now `{tastypie}` is [`tibble`](https://tibble.tidyverse.org/)-friendly: the user can also provide a `tibble` instead of a `dataframe` for the available functions. (#1)
* Improved the documentations of `pie_bake` and `pie_bake_pro`(added useful information about the labels and the `tibble` input).
* Solved the CRAN issue related to the importing of the [`magrittr`](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/magrittr/vignettes/magrittr.html) package that is not actually used.

# tastypie 0.0.2 - NOW AVAILABLE ON CRAN!

* Added the description of the function results in the documentations of `pie_bake`, `pie_bake_pro`, `pie_templates` and `pie_discover`.
* Solved some issues regarding the examples of the `pie_datacheck` function.

# tastypie 0.0.1

* Added a `NEWS.md` file to track changes to the package.
* Fixed package documentation (after spell_check).
* Added a package site.
* Fixed badges in `README`.
