You only need to type *"why pie charts are bad"* on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+pie+charts+are+bad) to find thousands of articles full of (very valid) reasons why this type of chart should not be used.  
**However**, my mother, a high school teacher of Latin and Italian literature, swears she understands more from something like this:

```{r,include=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  InYourOpinion = c("My mum", "Is", "Strange?"),
  value = c(20, 30, 50)
)
library(knitr)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="60%", out.height="60%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("man/figures/pie_readme.png")
```

than from something like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(df, "html")
```

Now, I love my mum, and I want her to be happy. Maybe there are other people in the world with this *particular problem*, so, why not help?  
Due to the little use due to the reasons that have already been presented, making pie charts in R is not immediate, so it is necessary to create functions to simplify things.  
  
In this R package there are useful functions for making **tasty pies** facilitating the use of functions already present in [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/).

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PaoloDalena/tastypie")
```

## Example

This is a basic example which shows you how to solve a common problem:

```{r example, eval = FALSE}
library(tastypie)
## basic example code
```
