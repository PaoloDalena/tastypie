You only need to type *"why pie charts are bad"* on [Google](https://www.google.com/search?q=why+pie+charts+are+bad) to find thousands of articles full of (very valid) reasons why this type of chart should not be used.  
[However](https://github.com/PaoloDalena/tastypie/blob/main/meme.jpeg), my mother, a high school teacher of Latin and Italian literature, swears she understands more from something like this:

```{r,include=FALSE}
df <- data.frame(
  InYourOpinion = c("My mum", "Is", "Strange?"),
  Value = c(60, 90, 150),
  Proportion = c(60, 90, 150)/(60+90+150)
)
```

```{r, echo=FALSE, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align = "center"}
include_graphics("man/figures/pie_readme.png")
```

than from something like this:

```{r, echo = FALSE}
kable(df, "html")
```

Now, I love my mum, and I want her to be happy. Maybe there are other people in the world with this *particular problem*, so, why not help?  
Due to the little use because of the already mentioned reasons, making pie (and related) charts in R is not straightforward, so it is necessary to have functions to simplify things.  
  
In this R package there are useful functions for making **tasty pies** exploiting some [ggplot2](https://ggplot2.tidyverse.org/) features.

## Installation

You can install the development version from [GitHub](https://github.com/) with:

``` {r, eval = FALSE}
# install.packages("devtools")
devtools::install_github("PaoloDalena/tastypie")
```

## Usage

**`{tastypie}`** allows the user to easily create many different pie charts based on different templates.  
  
Using **`pie_bake()`** you just have to choose a template and if you want the proportions to be displayed in the plot or not (if you want, you can also set a title and a group name):

```{r example, message=FALSE}
library(tastypie)
```

```{r, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align = "center", dpi = 400}
example <- data.frame(
  c("a. Is", "b. Not", "c. The", "d. Only", "e. One"),
  c(2.9, 6.9, 4.20, 13.12, 6.66)
)

pie_bake(data = example, template = "red1", perc = TRUE,
         title = "Perhaps", group_name = "She")
```

Or, if you want something more extravagant (*but probably less understandable*), choose a template and try **`pie_bake_pro()`**:

```{r, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align = "center", dpi = 400}
pie_bake_pro(data = example, template = "dart5",
             title = "Perhaps", group_name = "She")
```


Not sure which template to choose? Run **`pie_discover()`** to find out a random combination of templates, number of groups and features and get an idea of the many available plots:  
  
```{r, include=FALSE}
set.seed(897)
```
```{r, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align = "center", dpi = 400}
pie_discover()
```

Want to display an example of a particular template with particular features? Try **`pie_templates()`**:

```{r, out.width="75%", out.height="75%", fig.align = "center", dpi = 400}
pie_templates("eaten4", n_groups = 9)
```


Do you want a list of all the available templates? Check the **`pie_template_list`** and the **`pie_template_list_pro`** vectors!
```{r}
pie_template_list # to be used with pie_bake()

pie_template_list_pro # to be used with pie_bake_pro()
```

**Be curious, there are many tasty pies!**
